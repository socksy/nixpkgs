      Mill is a build tool borrowing ideas from modern tools like Bazel, to let you build
      your projects in a way that's simple, fast, and predictable. Mill has built in
      support for the Scala programming language, and can serve as a replacement for
      SBT, but can also be extended to support any other language or platform via
      modules (written in Java or Scala) or through an external subprocesses.
